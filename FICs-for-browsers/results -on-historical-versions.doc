The summarized issues for historical versions of chrome are as follows.
We first introduce the failure-inducing combinations, the IPM it belongs to and the possible undesirable effect.

1.	 
FIC: TP = source, MC = audio+video, CF = mp4
2.
FIC: TP = MediaSource, MC = pure audio, CF = aac, MIME = corresponding
3.
FIC: TP = MediaSource, MC = pure video, MIME = corresponding, ACDV = corresponding
4.
FIC: TP = MediaSource, MC = audio+video, MIME = corresponding, ACDV = none
5.
FIC: TP = MediaSource, CF = mp4 / webm, MIME = corresponding / mismatch, VCDV = none (13)
25.
FIC: MIME = invalid
26.
FIC: ACDV / VCDV = invalid
27.
FIC: MIME = mismatch, CF = ogv
28.
FIC: MIME= mismach, VCDV=corresponding (9)
29.
FIC: TP = source, MIME = corresponding, VCDV = mismatch (10)
30.
FIC: TP = MediaSource / source, MC = pure audio, CF = mp3, VCDV = none (11, 12)
31.
FIC: TP = source, MC = pure audio, CF = oga, MIME = mismatch, ACDV = corresponding, VCDV = none
Model: decoding
Effect: failed playback


6.
FIC: US = relative, CS = default
7.
FIC: US = http / https, CS = default, CR = anonymous / use-credentials
8.
FIC: US = http / https, CS = allow-all, CR = none / anonymous
9.
FIC: US = http / https, CS = allow-all, CR = use-credentials
Model: fetching
Effect: failed loading of media
10.
FIC: ME = video, US = http / https, CS = default, CR = anonymous / use-credentials
11.
FIC: ME = video, US = http / https, CS = allow-all, CR = use-credentials
12.
FIC: ME = video, US = http, CS = default, CR = use-credentials, PR = auto
Model: fetching
Effect: failed loading of poster

13.
FIC: AF = aac, IC = media, OC = media
Model: audio-play
Effect: failed playback
14.
FIC: AF = aac, IC = media, SR = 8 / 96 kHz
15.
FIC: AF = oga, IC = media, WH = first, HSR = less / more
Model: audio-play
Effect: the displayed duration in the control bar is a wrong number
16.
FIC: AF = oga, SR != 48kHz, IC = media, WH = first, HSR = less / more, HCN = equal
17.
FIC: AF = aac, BRM = vbr, IC = media, WH = second, HBRM = different
Model: audio-play
Effect: speeded-up or slowed-down playback speed
18.
FIC: AF = oga, CN = 5.1, IC = media, WH = first, HSR = equal
Model: audio-play
Effect: distorted sound

19.
FIC: VF = mp4, FR = 2 ftps
20.
FIC: VF = mp4, FR = 25 ftps, RR = 720p
21.
FIC: VF = webm, IC = media
22.
FIC: CSS = 4:4:4, IC = media
Model: video-play
Effect: failed playback
23.
FIC: VF = mp4, IC = media, FR = 2ftps, CSS = 4:2:2, RR = 720p
Model: video-play
Effect: wrong duration
24.
FIC: VF = mp4 / ogv, IC = media, CSS != 4:2:0
Model: video-play
Effect: abnormal video image
