The summarized failure inducing combinations for historical versions of chrome are as follows.
We first introduce the FIC, the IPM it belongs to and the possible undesirable effect.
Then we draw a table to demonstrate the browser versions that a FIC might influence.

1.	 
FIC: TP = media, MC = audio+video, CF = mp4
Model: decoding
Effect: failed playback
2.
FIC: TP = MediaSource, MC = pure audio, CF = aac, MIME = corresponding
Model: decoding
Effect: failed playback
3.
FIC: TP = MediaSource, MC = pure video, MIME = corresponding, ACDV = corresponding
Model: decoding
Effect: failed playback
4.
FIC: TP = MediaSource, MC = pure video / audio+video, MIME = corresponding, CDV = none
Model: decoding
Effect: failed playback
5.
FIC: TP = MediaSource, MC = audio+video, MIME = corresponding, ACDV = none
Model: decoding
Effect: failed playback
6.

Model: fetching
Effect: failed loading of media
7.

Model: audio-play
Effect: the displayed duration in the control bar is a wrong number
16.
